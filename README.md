## Topmind Care (Mindery Kids) â€“ Landing App

A responsive React single-page app showcasing Mindery Kids programs, features, pricing, reviews, and a popup lead form. Built for fast iteration with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS v4.

### Key Features

- **Accessible anchor navigation**: `href="#why"`, `#programs`, `#features`, `#pricing`, `#faq`

### UX & Accessibility Notes
- Global `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }`
- `section[id] { scroll-margin-top: 88px }` to prevent headings from being hidden by the fixed navbar (adjust if navbar height changes)
- Buttons and links have clear focus styles and large tap targets
